C3 Impact Website

## Deployment framework

- Investigate netlify plugin to control the build for content updates - not essential right now. We can live will all sites being deployed at the same time.
- Tailwind presets for the different brands, base brand etc (this can be later)
- refactor components out into package(s) to share between the sites - currently I have copied items. - Use slicemachine when it is available for gatsby.

  - Slices can be refactored into 2 obvious parts: data querying and presentation
